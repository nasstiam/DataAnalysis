ABC Analysis classifies inventory items into three categories based on their value and importance 
to the business: A (high-value items), B (medium-value items), and C (low-value items).

The Pareto Principle says that most results come from only 20% of efforts or causes in any system. 
Based on Pareto's 80/20 rule, ABC analysis identifies the 20% of goods that deliver about 80% of the value.

In ABC analysis for Backery sales I am indentifying the most valuebale products that bring high revenue
